# üè∑Ô∏è Metaverse Project

## üìù Description
This repository hosts a "Metaverse" project, a modern web application designed to create immersive 3D experiences. Leveraging the power of modern web technologies, it aims to provide an interactive virtual environment accessible directly through the browser. The project appears to be built using Next.js, indicating a focus on performance, SEO, and developer experience. It's deployed on Vercel, which suggests a server-rendered or static-generated frontend application, optimized for quick load times and scalability. The application likely features interactive 3D scenes, models, and a responsive user interface to explore digital spaces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup Instructions
To set up and run this Metaverse project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikkyeya/metaverse.git
    cd metaverse
    
```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```
bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    
```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```
bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    
```

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    The application will typically open at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîë Environment Variables
This project might require environment variables for certain functionalities, such as API keys for external services or configuration settings.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add any necessary variables:

```
dotenv
# Example: If using an external service API key
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SOME_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
#
# (Add any other specific environment variables required by the project here)

```
*(Please refer to the project's source code or any provided documentation within the repository for specific environment variables if external services are integrated beyond the core functionality).*

## üöÄ Deployment / Hosting Instructions
The project is set up for deployment on Vercel, as indicated by its nature as a Next.js application. Here's how you can deploy your own instance:

### Deploying to Vercel:
1.  **Connect to Vercel:** Sign up for a Vercel account (if you don't have one) and connect your GitHub account.
2.  **Import Project:** Import your `metaverse` repository as a new project on Vercel.
3.  **Configure Build & Output Settings:** Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and configure the build command (`next build`) and output directory (`.next`).
4.  **Environment Variables:** If your project utilizes any environment variables (from the [üîë Environment Variables](#%F0%9F%GetKey-environment-variables) section), add them in your Vercel project settings under the "Environment Variables" section.
5.  **Deploy:** Vercel will then build and deploy your application. Subsequent pushes to the `main` branch (or your configured production branch) will trigger automatic redeployments.

### Manual Build for other Static Hosts:
If you prefer to deploy to a different static hosting service, you can generate a production-ready build:
```
bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build

```
This command creates an optimized build in the `.next` directory (for Next.js projects), which you can then deploy to any static hosting provider capable of serving Next.js static exports or server-side rendered applications.
